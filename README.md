# drfrf

## To do

- [ ] Build a redux-form-saga / DRF connector from the `mapError` function on Mi Casa
  - Extract it form the code
  - Refactor
  - Put it on a separate git repo
  - Try to install it on Mi Casa
- [ ] Improve the JS API: use a HOC?
- [ ] Make it easier to install
  - Re-organize the repo so that we can add it as a dependency in `package.json` and `requirements.txt`/`Pipfile`
